--Introduction--

Ultra Mode 7 simulates the Mode 7 rendering mode from the SNES by using 3D
rendering. Sprites are scaled appropriately and use additional code to
determine whether they are visible, because of cut-off distance. The view
of a Mode 7 map is defined by the following parameters:

- camera distance
- camera Y position
- field of view
- pitch rotation angle
- yaw rotation angle
- maximum Z coordinate

--How to use--

Separate maps can control and even dynamically change most paramaters. In
order to turn a normal map into a Mode 7 map, custom parameters need to be
defined in the "Note" section of the map. To use the default values for a
map, simply add the following entry to the map "note":

<UltraMode7>

If any other parameter is defined, this is not necessary. The following
parameters can be defined:

- UltraMode7_FOV
- UltraMode7_Pitch
- UltraMode7_Yaw
- UltraMode7_CameraDistance
- UltraMode7_CameraY
- UltraMode7_FadeColor
- UltraMode7_ParallaxDistance
- UltraMode7_Border
- UltraMode7_BorderHorizontal
- UltraMode7_BorderVertical
- UltraMode7_BorderLeft
- UltraMode7_BorderRight
- UltraMode7_BorderTop
- UltraMode7_BorderBottom

Example:

<UltraMode7_FOV:50>

When multiple parameters are defined, simply add them one after another.
Example:

<UltraMode7_Pitch:50>
<UltraMode7_CameraDistance:400>
<UltraMode7_CameraY:20>
<UltraMode7_Yaw:45>
<UltraMode7_FadeColor:1,1,0.5>
<UltraMode7_ParallaxDistance:800>
<UltraMode7_BorderVertical:4>

--How to change parameters dynamically--

The 4 parameters that can be defined in the note section of a map can also
be changed at any time during the map. Following calls are available:

UltraMode7.setFov(DEGREES)
UltraMode7.setPitch(DEGREES)
UltraMode7.setYaw(DEGREES)
UltraMode7.setCameraDistance(Z_DISTANCE)
UltraMode7.setCameraY(Y_POSITION)
UltraMode7.setFadeColor(RGB_COLOR)
UltraMode7.setFadeBegin(RGB_COLOR)
UltraMode7.setFadeEnd(RGB_COLOR)
UltraMode7.setParallaxDistance(DISTANCE)
UltraMode7.setTilemapPixelated(TRUE_FALSE)

You can also obtain the current values with these calls:

UltraMode7.getFov()
UltraMode7.getPitch()
UltraMode7.getYaw()
UltraMode7.getCameraDistance()
UltraMode7.getCameraY()
UltraMode7.getFadeColor()
UltraMode7.getFadeBegin()
UltraMode7.getFadeEnd()
UltraMode7.getParallaxDistance()
UltraMode7.isTilemapPixelated()

You can also change the values in an animated manner:

UltraMode7.animateFov(TARGET_VALUE, FRAMES_DURATION)
UltraMode7.animatePitch(TARGET_VALUE, FRAMES_DURATION)
UltraMode7.animateYaw(TARGET_VALUE, FRAMES_DURATION)
UltraMode7.animateCameraDistance(TARGET_VALUE, FRAMES_DURATION)
UltraMode7.animateCameraY(TARGET_VALUE, FRAMES_DURATION)
UltraMode7.animateFadeColor(TARGET_VALUE, FRAMES_DURATION)
UltraMode7.animateFadeBegin(TARGET_VALUE, FRAMES_DURATION)
UltraMode7.animateFadeEnd(TARGET_VALUE, FRAMES_DURATION)

Parallax distance cannot be animated due to its internal implementation relying
on fixed values.

--Additional Notes--

- When using parallax backgrounds due to how rendering is done, it's useful
  to have a custom parallax that fades into white and creates a seamless
  transition into the faded tiles. Make sure to adjust for changes in the
  pitch angle as well.
- Larger values for NEAR_CLIP_Z can help reduce problems with characters
  becoming very large when they are close to the camera and if a low pitch
  value is used.
- Smaller values of FAR_CLIP_Z will cause characters and the tilemap
  to be cut off earlier. Effectively it moves the cut-off horizon closer.
- If you don't want white fade-out, set both FADE_Z values to a larger value
  than FAR_CLIP_Z.
- When the yaw value is changed, characters are turned around accordingly, but
  controls aren't changed.
- Consider using the same values for BASE_SCALE_Z and DEFAULT_CAMERA_DISTANCE.
- Ultra Mode 7 is setup to display the player character in the middle of the
  screen with a pixel-perfect scale of 1:1. When using DEFAULT_CAMERA_Y, keep
  in mind that positioning the camera above or below changes the player
  position in 3D space and you may want to consider using a different value for
  BASE_SCALE_Z.
- If you use a FOV of 0, the display mode will switch to orthogonal projection.
- When using looping maps, the change of FOV, camera distance and far-clip
  Z-plane might require recalculation of the entire tilemap and can cause
  momentary performance drops so it should be used sparingly. If you absolutely
  require dynamic changes of these parameters by large values, you can increase
  the option LOOP_MAPS_EXTEND_TILES to decrease the likelyhood of the
  recalculation to happen.
- When using a real-time system with day-night transition, it might be better
  to apply the fade color constantly as a derived value from the day-night
  coloring rather than using fade color animation.
- When using UltraMode7_Border, all other border options will be ignored.
- When using UltraMode7_BorderHorizontal, UltraMode7_BorderLeft and
  UltraMode7_BorderRight will be ignored.
- When using UltraMode7_BorderVertical, UltraMode7_BorderTop and
  UltraMode7_BorderBottom will be ignored.
- Looped maps ignore all border settings.
- If using CHARACTERS_USE_FADE_Z, keep in mind that other plugins might
  override the blend-color value for the sprite or get overriden by
  Ultra Mode 7.

--Technical details, limitations and compatibility--

- Requires WebGL. Does not work with canvas and due to how canvas works, it
  can never support canvas.
- Due to sprite scaling, how character sprite sheets are organized and how
  pixel interpolation is done when scaling is applied, there can be artifacts
  during rendering of characters. Manipulating the FAR_CLIP_Z value can
  help remove these artifacts to some degree.
- The tilemap is rendered in its entirety and the projection matrix is used
  to limit visibility. The hardware should take care of optimizing rendering.
- Due to a hard limit of 65536 vertices being rendered at once in WebGL, the
  code has been adjusted to render the tilemap in as many passes as necessary.
  Since some people reported issues even with 65536 vertices, a soft lower
  limit is being used within the script.
- Because the tilemap is rendered entirely flat, tile priority isn't used.
- The option TILEMAP_PIXELATED and change via UltraMode7.setTilemapPixelated()
  affects non-Mode 7 maps as well.
- Scaling has been optimized for usage of an FOV of 60°. Using different
  values will cause some weird scales being used for characters.
- Using low values for FOV will likely cause display issues (except for 0°
  which will activate orthogonal projection).
- Due to yaw rotation requiring turning of characters, 8-directional
  characters sprites might have only limited support.
- When using looping maps, don't make them too small. Event positioning on the
  map border could cause issues otherwise.
- Possibly not compatible with scripts that manipulate tilemap data too much
  or too deeply.
- Compatible with KhasUltraLighting. Put Ultra Mode 7 BELOW that plugin.
- Compatible with Yanfly's Grid-Free Doodads. Put Ultra Mode 7 BELOW that plugin.
  The "z" coordinate in doodads is not supported.
- Compatible with MOG's Character Motion. Put Ultra Mode 7 BELOW that plugin.
- Compatible with Thomas Edison MV. Put Ultra Mode 7 BELOW that plugin.
- Compatible with Quasi Simple Shadows. Put Ultra Mode 7 BELOW that plugin.
- Compatible with some newer pixi-tilemap versions.
- Possibly not compatible with custom character objects that don't derive
  from Game_Event.
  
--Custom compatibility code

- This script can be made compatible with the script
  "Terrax Plugins - Lighting system", but due to the way it's
  written, the compatibility needs to be done manually. Find this segment of
  code:

if (flashlight == true) {
	this._maskBitmap.radialgradientFillRect2(lx1, ly1, 0, light_radius, colorvalue, '#000000', ldir, flashlength, flashwidth);
} else {
	this._maskBitmap.radialgradientFillRect(lx1, ly1, 0, light_radius, colorvalue, '#000000', objectflicker, brightness, direction);
}

  Replace it with this:
  
var visible = true;
if ($gameMap.useUltraMode7)
{
	const position = UltraMode7.mapToScreen(lx1, ly1 + ph / 2);
	if ($gameMap.ultraMode7Fov > 0)
	{
		const z = position.z;
		if (z <= UltraMode7.NEAR_CLIP_Z && z >= UltraMode7.FAR_CLIP_Z)
		{
			visible = false;
		}
	}
	if (visible)
	{
		const scale = UltraMode7.mapToScreenScale(lx1, ly1);
		lx1 = position.x;
		ly1 = position.y -= ph / 2 * scale;
		light_radius *= scale;
	}
}
if (visible)
{
	if (flashlight === true)
	{
		this._maskBitmap.radialgradientFillRect2(lx1, ly1, 0, light_radius, colorvalue, '#000000', ldir, flashlength, flashwidth);
	}
	else
	{
		this._maskBitmap.radialgradientFillRect(lx1, ly1, 0, light_radius, colorvalue, '#000000', objectflicker, brightness, direction);
	}
}
  
  This will make "Terrax Plugins - Lighting system" work with Ultra Mode 7.
