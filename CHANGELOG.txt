                              ALPHA 15 CHANGELOG
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Alpha 15 (??/??/????)
APOCALYPSE
Current Level Cap: 25
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
Sometimes I get tired of repeating myself over and over again, but am I wrong to say that every major update has the best one yet? If we're ignoring the pre-Alpha 11 days, then no, I'm not wrong, and Alpha 15 further solidifies this point.
Building off of the heavy overhauls introduced in Alpha 14, this brand new update focuses on a TON of new content that fits with the new standards. Whether it be juicy lore, fresh dungeons, brand new concepts, new explorations of equipment and mechanics, and even more... it's content! So much great content!

Telluria Castle Town serves as the hub for EVERYTHING to get an upgrade. From hats to shields to upgrade scrolls to food to spell tomes... the list goes on and on. New enemies with never-before strength serve as a test of strategy, the new equipment, and the higher level cap that introduces unique and powerful skills.
Head off to the Lost Forest and World Tree to fight nature-themed enemies, or maybe take a stop in the Frozen Labyrinth first to get some icy equipment. Maybe you can stop and fish for a bit to pass the time and get some ingredients for tasty food. With so much to do, choice is everywhere in Alpha 15...
...and eventually, all these choices come together to direct the party to someone who's been but a hated faceless name for the entirety of the adventure. Everything comes down to this. Every update has further built up suspense and tension for this. The time has arrived.

Now, let's get to the incredibly large changelog, the biggest one we've ever had. Note that this changelog will include Alpha 13 items reintroduced alongside the Ruined Fort.

Changes:
 - Recapped the max level from level 20 to level 25.
 - Replaced the Mage class's 2nd magic equip slot with an offhand slot (light shields).
 - The game's icons have finally been resprited at a non-blurred 32px resolution. Many items have additionally had their icons changed to stand out a bit more.
 - Skill families will now be condensed into a single dropdown. Old save patching must be enabled when updating for this to work properly.
 - Completed the salvaging system. Many items throughout the entire game are now salvageable, making the system much more relevant.
 - Changed up the preloader / title screen background.
 - Reverted most dungeons back to the old dungeon map border style (same as the indoors style).
 - Many shops have had their stock changed. Some enemy drop pools have also been adjusted.
 - The 4-skeleton enemy troop now spawns frequently anywhere in the "Forest Arena...?" after the penultimate Laeryidyean cutscene.
  ~ Additionally, the Adonian Monsters troop has been altered. No troops with the Skeleton can be encountered anymore, effectively removing the enemy from the game.
 - Uncrafted items now display their mask name if in an ingredient list. Additionally, the color of an ingredient now changes depending on if the player has enough of the item.
 - Being defeated by a Lost Soul in the Great Pyramid will now send you back to the start of the dungeon instead of giving a game over.
 - Unknown enemy weaknesses now show a question mark icon.
 - Removed the Raw Fish and Cooked Fish items due to the new fishing system having specific types of fish and dishes.
 - The night overlay now shows in battle.
 - Changed the respawn time of Copper Oreleaf from 36 minutes to 30 minutes.
 - Moved Change of Heart to the Magic skill category.
 - Presents now have a 50% drop chance on December 25th rather than the default 20%.
 - Red Gel can now be used on party members in battle.
 - Sharpened battleback images.
 - Countless other small changes have been made throughout the game (not as much as Alpha 14, but still a lot of new quality-of-life stuff).

Music Update (Final Wave):
 - Redid "New Lands".

Balancing:
 - Heavily rebalanced stat allocation.
  ~ All AP is multiplied by x4 now, making the max AP at level 100 be 10,000 instead of the old 2,500.
  ~ JP costs of all allocations have been greatly increased, now making JP the main limiting factor for allocation.
 - Heavily nerfed the recovery of the Potion, Elixir, and Ether.
  ~ Potion's HP recovery was reduced from 90 to 60, and Elixir's MP recovery was reduced from 36 to 24.
  ~ Since Ether heals ~20% more HP/MP than its Potion/Elixir counterpart, it has been nerfed accordingly.
 - All party members now gain +1 INT per 5 levels, for a total of +20 INT at level 100 and +5 INT at Alpha 15's level cap of 25.
 - Revival now increases success rate instead of healing when using BP.
 - Wand Impulse and Backstab now only heavily decrease MAT/ATK (respectively) for 2 turns instead of 3.
 - Channel Divinity I and Cure II's learn levels have been swapped to now be learned at levels 8 and 11, respectively.
 - Nerfed the Rogue class's base HIT, EVA, and CRI by 1% each.
 - Nerfed the Steel Axe's stun chance by 5% (was originally 10%).
 - Nerfed Mana Refund's return to 1% of damage dealt (was originally 5%).
 - Nerfed Foresight's MP cost to 12 MP (was originally 8 MP).
 - Increased price of Metal Wristbraces ★ from 180B to 300B.
 - Gave Bloodlust +2% PLS.
 - Nerfed CRI of Red Mask from +2% to +1%.
 - Reworked Blood-Red Headband to grant +0.5% PLS and +3 AGI rather than +4% MHP and +3% CRI. Price has increased from 80B to 120B
 - Buffed the drop chance of rare enemy accessories from 1/3 to 1/2.
 - Ethers no longer require Bits to craft. Their price has been adjusted accordingly.
 - Buffed the Knight's Greaves' DEF by 1 and AGI by 2 and also gave them +0.5% EVA and +0.5% CRI to be able to compete with the Leather Boots.
 - All levels of Well Fed increase ATK and MAT by +2%, +4%, and +6% at each respective level (respectively).
 - Increased Player 1's base MHP at levels 1 and 2 from [40, 48] to [48, 54].
 - Replaced The Warden's Darkfire with Engulfing Darkness, which is mechanically the same skill except it does not debuff MDF.
 - Greatly increased the acceleration of the EXP curve at later levels. This barely affects the game in its current state considering the level cap is 25, but this change will help future proof the late- and end-game.
 - Many other small changes have been made to equipment/item stats, prices, and crafting recipes, as well as enemy stats/drops.

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed a game-breaking bug that I could have sworn was already fixed where you could push a boulder in Laeryidyean's Forest - Left Connector off the boulder tiles.
 - Fixed a bug where conditional drops did not work correctly (e.g. night boosted enemies did not properly increase their item drop rate).
 - Fixed a bug where the little loot explosion after defeating an enemy sometimes did not show the correct drops.
 - Fixed a bug where some mid-battle boss monologues would interrupt turns or even action sequences instead of playing between turns.
 - Fixed a bug where the Suffering Soul had only 25% physical element damage reduction rather than the intended 50%.
 - Fixed a bug where Brawl Brew and Warding Swig would not bypass death removal.
 - Fixed a bug where On Fire!'s damage at the end of every turn was half of the intended value.
 - Fixed a bug where life steal attributes with decimals would not be parsed correctly.
 - Fixed a bug where playtime wouldn't increase correctly on non-60hz displays.
 - Fixed a bug where the crafted weapons/armor counters could be wrong.
 - Fixed a bug where some resistance accessory drop rates were lower than intended (1% instead of 2%).
 - Fixed a bug where elemental weapons did not count as physical-elemental hits.
 - Fixed a bug where INT slightly affected state application rates.
 - Fixed a bug where exiting the keyboard config menu would fade the options menu back in instead directly cutting to it.
 - Fixed a bug where magic skills used the wrong motion when casting.
 - Fixed a bug where battlers affected by Frozen I would still have their sprite move if an action sequence commanded them to.
 - Fixed a bug where vA.14.7 removed Solus Town's snow but neglected to remove the snow around it in the overworld.
 - Just like usual, a huge amount of minor bugs, textual errors, and visual issues were corrected in this release.

Alpha 10.2 and the updates preceding it served to build the foundation of The Trail, allowing me to start learning how to make a game that was mechanically sound and coherent.
Alpha 11 ported the game to RPG Maker MV and added Laeryidyean, bringing an end to the adventure down Adon and opening up a world of possibilties for the future.
Alpha 12 was the first steps in Telluria and began to explore more complex mechanics and ideas. The quality-of-life changes also served to be a good lesson in how to effectively reflect on my work and polish it.
Alpha 13 introduced the Blazing Sands, the biggest content expansion in The Trail's history at the time. Crafting became a huge feature in the game, and the new dungeons alongside the story further upped the bar for what determined a good update.
Alpha 14 took the best parts of all these updates, made them even better, then applied them to the entire game. Words can't really describe how much this update evolved the game's quality and changed it forever.

All these updates have led up to this day. Alpha 15 introduces crazy new plot development, tons of unique equipment, mind-bending dungeons, and just a lot of new... everything.
This update finally allows the game to embody what I always thought it felt like: a real adventure. Alpha 15 truly defines what The Trail is about.

I won't make promises I won't keep, so I can't guarantee Alpha 16 will come anytime soon. Maybe it'll be another Alpha 14, or maybe it'll add a ton of new content like Alpha 15. Who knows? That day will come eventually.

Until then...

...the journey continues.

Yours truly,
Andrew

                             ALPHA 14.7 CHANGELOG
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Alpha 14.7 (1/1/2022)
Current Level Cap: 20
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
Fixed a game-breaking bug where fighting the Giant Goblin after being sent by the Village Chief would completely lock a save's progression, essentially ruining the file.
This bug will be fixed in saves already affected by it, as long as old save patching is enabled.
Additionally, the snow over Solus Town has melted.
Oh, and happy new year, everyone!

Alpha 14.6 (12/22/2021)
Current Level Cap: 20
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
Fixed a game-breaking bug where fresh downloads of the game would immediately crash upon attempting to save.

Alpha 14.5 (12/21/2021)
Current Level Cap: 20
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
This is a very technical update, mainly serving to continue improving the gameplay experience and make a few small QoL changes.

Additions:
 - Added actual descriptions to vanity items. They will show the set they are a part of, as well as a short summary of what the outfit looks like.
 - Re-added the category separators on the options menu. Additionally, 2 new options were added:
  ~ Disable Old Save Patching: Disables the automatic patching of old saves when updating.
  ~ Equipping Item Stays on Equip Window: When enabled, equipping an item will not return to the equipment slots window.
 - Added new information to the save menu.
  ~ Each save now shows its native version, which is updated every time it is saved in a different version. Pre-vA.14.5 saves or saves missing their version info will display as an unknown version.
  ~ Saves will also show the time that they were last saved, adjusted for the user's time zone. The time since the last save is also shown.
 - Although technically a change, a new damage popup system has replaced the old one. It comes with both visual and internal changes.
  ~ Skills and states that did not show damage popups (e.g. anything involving SP) will now either show a popup or work as intended.
 - The equip compare menu now shows life steal and attack element changes.
 - The status menu's "Attributes" page now shows life steal stats.

Changes:
 - Replaced the Forge Badge and Enchanting Badge with the Disposable Hammer and Enchanting Crystal, respectively. This is only a visual change, and the items still function exactly the same.
 - Obtaining any craftable item will mark it as crafted, even before hitting the Blazing Sands. This unmasks the name of the item and counts it towards the total crafting progress statistics in the crafting menu.
 - Loading/renaming a save now marks it as the "last accessed" file, making it automatically selected when the save menu is open.
 - Opening the options/save menu on the title screen will smoothly fade out the title screen and fade in the new menu. Leaving the menu will fade it out, then fade the title screen back in.
 - Adjusted the layout of the status menu's "Attributes" page. Additionally, the first two columns of attributes have had their names reformatted.
 - The equipment comparison menu now rounds the difference of most stats to 1 decimal place.
 - Reverted the new item indicator's appearance to its vA.14.0-UNST1 state.
 - The new item indicator now shows on the victory aftermath screen again.
 - Removed equip restrictions on Terra and Bubble (Tome).
 - When changing the equipment in a party member's Vanity slot, unequippable vanity items will not be shown.
 - Adjusted dialogue in Adon finale dream cutscene.
 - The preloader will now load animation files.
 - Changed the icons of the Charm of Foresight and several vanity items.

Balancing:
 - Nerfed the Sacrificial Dagger's CRI boost from +3% to +1.5%.

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed a bug where unallocating HP/MP when full would reduce MHP/MMP, then additionally remove another 5/3 HP/MP, leaving the party member without full HP/MP.
 - Fixed a bug where two completely unobtainable weapons were being added to the total weapons crafted stat's denominator.
 - Fixed a bug where the spacing of letters on name input screens would be uneven.
 - Fixed a bug where the sell price of Bronze/Steel Alloys was abnormally high... 3x higher than intended, in fact.
 - Fixed a bug where Player 4's vanities were still causing her face graphic to smile when in Telluria, even though this was meant to be removed in vA.14.3.
 - Fixed a bug where the Sea BGS would not fade out during the cutscene where the party clears the dirt pile in the north of the Blazing Sands.
 - Fixed many textual errors.

Items being automatically marked as crafted will work retroactively with previous saves. As long as an item has been hovered over in the items menu at least once before updating, the updated save will mark the item as crafted.
Run over all the items in your inventory before updating to be sure they don't have the new item indicator. This will ensure that any craftable items are properly marked as crafted.

                             ALPHA 14.4 CHANGELOG
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Alpha 14.4 (12/16/2021)
Current Level Cap: 20
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
Considering that Alpha 14.3 was intended to be the last sub-alpha with notable content, Alpha 14.4 doesn't have anything too crazy. However, there's plenty of bug fixes and changes that make this update worth it!

Additions:
 - Added 2 new armors:
  ~ Iron Boots
  ~ Slime Scarf
 - Added a new feature that allows save files to be renamed.

Changes:
 - Player 4 no longer learns Steal Item at level 12, and will instead learn Offensive Stance. Transferred saves with Player 4 already at level 12 or above will automatically have her skills updated.
 - Deleting a save file will now just apply .bak to the end of the file instead of completely deleting it, allowing accidentally deleted save files to be retrieved.
 - A Game Over will now be triggered if the entire party is afflicted with either Downed or Terrified.
  ~ This was mainly done to prevent long battles against Lost Souls when your only living party members were incapacitated by Terrified.
 - Will now sells ATK, MAT, DEF, and MDF scrolls.
 - The Knight and Rogue classes now have a Magic Equip equipment slot.
 - The shop menu's sell window now shows category icons in a 4x4 grid.
 - Puzzle reset buttons now require confirmation before resetting the puzzle.
 - Changed the recipe for Vishnu's Charm to use the Slime Scarf.
 - Slightly increased the encounter rate in the Bandito Hideout.
 - Some dialogues will be altered slightly depending on actions that have been done during the game (e.g. the party only knows about the Archaic Hourglass when fighting The Warden if Will has given them the quest).

Balancing:
 - Changed around some item drop rates.
  ~ Buffed the drop rate of rare enemy accessories from 20% to 33.3%.
  ~ Buffed the drop rate of status resistance accessories from 1% to 2%.
  ~ Buffed the drop rate of presents from 10% to 20%.
 - Adjusted the Floppy Hat ★ and the Prayer Headpiece to function more as counterparts to each other, with the former focusing on MAT and the latter focusing on MDF.
 - Buffed Ice I's MAT multiplier from 200% to 225%.
 - Nerfed The Warden's offensive stats slightly to allow for more fair on-level interactions.

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed a bug with the Lost Soul AI that caused battles against it to sometimes take a really long time. The bug also sometimes prevented party members from being able to do anything for no apparent reason.
 - Fixed a bug with the Lightning I/II chain lightning formulas.
 - Fixed a bug where saves transferred from vA.14.4 would softlock upon entering Player 1's house. This was because the "Player 2's Meal" cutscene would be triggered.
 - Fixed a bug where boosting and then unboosting could allow escape from normally unescapable battles.
 - Fixed a bug where Shield of Faith and Strength Within the Blade's shield would expire after 5 or 2 turns, respectively.
 - Fixed a bug where Player 3 and Player 4 could escape Sector 4 when ditching the rest of the party.
 - Fixed a bug where The Warden wouldn't apply Terrified to the party at the beginning of his battle.
 - Fixed a bug where Henry's Play Dirty skill could fill up the battle log.
 - Fixed a bug where skills with a learn requirement of level 0 would still show the level requirement.
 - Fixed several bugs related to interactions between the Blazing Sands's godrays and the nighttime overlay.
 - Fixed several bugs related to footstep sounds in many locations.
 - Fixed an oddly specific bug related to the statue of Trailia in Solus Valley and the Shop Menu Stat Compare Style option.
 - Fixed many other minor bugs.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Alpha 14.3 (12/11/2021)
Current Level Cap: 20
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
This sub-alpha is a pretty important one! It shakes up the progression in early Telluria, and fixes a ton of bugs. Let's get straight into the changelog!

Additions:
 - Added in a brand new cutscene at the start of Chapter 3.
  ~ This cutscene replaces some old content, notably the camping cutscene when first setting foot on Telluria.
 - Added in 4 new Vanity equipment items.
  ~ Retro Knight/Mage/Cleric/Rogue Outfit
  ~ Each can be purchased from the Holiday Merchant for 3 Leeks. A more permanent home for them will be found in a future update.
 - Revamped the equipment menu.
  ~ The layout has been completely redone.
  ~ The window on the right now has headings for which section is being shown (Stat Comparison, Item Info, Restrictions).
 - Revamped the shop menu stat comparison window.
  ~ Now shows 1 stat for 4 party members by default rather than the old 8 stats for 1 party member. The old style can be reverted to in the settings.
  ~ If a party member is unable to equip a piece of equipment present in the shop, it will say so.
  ~ Class icons are shown on each party member's name.

Changes:
 - Completely redid the Easin Plains progression to allow the player to go in any order.
  ~ Greenfield, the Water Elemental, Solus Valley, and the Giant Goblin: that's right, you can tackle them in any order you want now!
  ~ All dialogue, quest log entries, etc. will be automatically adjusted depending on what order you do everything in.
 - Improved the experience of navigating Laeryidyean's Forest.
 - Made changes to the dream cutscene at the end of Chapter 2.

Balancing:
 - Adjusted Cut Down.
  ~ Only ignores 50% of enemy DEF rather than all of it.
  ~ Can now land critical hits.
 - Heavily nerfed Goblin/Goblin Captain common item drop rates.
 - Nerfed the EVA and CRI provided by Leather/Hermes Boots.

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed a bug where bosses with the Night Boost status effect and an ending sequence at 0% health could never actually start that ending sequence.
 - Fixed a bug with the Ruby/Emerald Ring drop sources.
 - Fixed tons of minor visual/textual bugs.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Alpha 14.2 (11/30/2021)
Current Level Cap: 20
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
Another sub-alpha! This one fixes quite a few bugs with the game, and also addresses feedback given by the community.

Additions:
 - Re-added the equip optimize button, a missed feature from Alpha 13.
 - Recovery item descriptions will show how much HP/MP they recover, both static and percentage.
 - Added a merchant in Sector 2 of Adon that sells Small Potions and Small Elixirs. He will disappear after Laeryidyean has been defeated.
  ~ As a result of this, the soldier outside the Bandito Hideout that's always sold Small Elixirs will now sell them at 16B rather than 20B.
 
Changes:
 - Replaced Player 1's Defend I/II and Mark skills with three new skills.
  ~ Hold the Line I: Learned by Player 1 at level 5.
  ~ Hold the Line II: Learned by Player 1 through the skill menu starting at level 15.
  ~ Weak Point: Learned by Player 1 at level 7.
  ~ All enemies that used Defend I/II or Mark in their AI have had their AI modified to use the new skills.
  ~ Already-existing save files will retroactively learn the new skills and have the old ones removed. Mastery levels will be migrated.
 - Equip restrictions on all hats except Matt's Fedora have been removed. Have fun mixing and matching!
 - The status menu and equip comparison menu now have 1 decimal of precision for stats other than the main 8.
 - Player 1, Player 2, and Player 4 can now all learn Analyze using the skill learn menu.
 - Skeleton Warriors and Skeleton Mages can now drop Small Potions and Small Elixirs.
 - Completely disabled the battle intro. It was just too buggy and the effect wasn't worth it. Besides, most people just turn it off after the first few times.
 - Reduced the amount of skeletons found in Laeryidyean's Forest - Center.
 - Trimmed down some dialogue in a few spots.

Balancing:
 - Nerfed the Skeleton Mage.
  ~ ATK: 10 → 8
  ~ DEF: 12 → 9
  ~ MAT: 24 → 20
  ~ MDF: 24 → 20
  ~ Cure I will now be used at or below 30% HP rather than the old 50%.
  ~ Cure I will only have a 60% chance of being used when meeting the HP condition rather than the old 100%.
 - Nerfed the Skeleton Warrior.
  ~ MDF: 20 → 12
 - Reduced the cost of Floppy Hat ★ from 50B to 35B.
 - Nerfed Charm of Foresight from +10% CEV to +5% CEV

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed an annoying bug where skipping through Player 2's dialogue during the walk-and-talk with him could softlock the game.
 - The Items menu and the Run Away option can no longer be selected with at least 1 boost active.
 - Fixed a bug where Player 2 could leave Sector 2 by himself while Player 1 and Mark are talking.
 - A lot of minor textual errors were fixed.

                             ALPHA 14.1 CHANGELOG
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Alpha 14.1 (11/26/2021)
Current Level Cap: 20
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
Here we are, the first sub-alpha for Alpha 14. It came quickly, too!
This little update mainly serves to add... holiday content! That's right, for the month of December, you'll get access to some fun new stuff.
Additionally, some issues found in Alpha 14 have been addressed in order to further improve the gameplay experience.

Additions:
 - The holidays are here! A few special things will start happening during the month of December:
  ~ Every enemy in the game has a 10% chance to drop a Present.
  ~ A new NPC known as the Holiday Merchant can be found in all 6 towns in the game, even during the prologue. He'll sell you all the new holiday items in exchange for Presents.
  ~ The game's window skin receives a jolly coat of paint. Additionally, the menu particles change to snowflakes!
 - The affectionately dubbed "Snowlus Town" has returned at long last! I unfortunately don't know how to automate the tiles changing just yet, so the town will be reverted to its old greenness in the first update of 2022.
 - Added in 7 new holiday themed items:
  ~ Present
  ~ Fizzy Cranberry Beverage
  ~ Festive Sword/Wand/Staff/Dagger Scroll
  ~ Icon Reset Scroll
 - Added in 5 new holiday themed weapons:
  ~ Candy Cane Sword/Wand/Staff/Dagger
  ~ Leek Sword
 - Added in 5 new holiday themed armors:
  ~ Festive Armor/Robes/Vestments/Leathers
  ~ Candy Cane Shield
 - Aside from those, another 6 armors have been added to the game that can be found at any time:
  ~ Leather Charm
  ~ Music Box
  ~ Vishnu's Charm
  ~ Condensed White Gel
  ~ Metallic Rat Pelt
  ~ Arcane Leather Charm
  
Changes:
 - Changed around drops of state resistance accessories to be more consistent. Additionally, the accessories will always have a 1% drop from their enemy type, regardless if the specific enemy is normal, rare, or a boss.
 - The location of the Bandito Loot found in the drawers in the Bandito Hideout has been randomized using the new "Playthrough Seed" set at the start of each run. It's a 50/50 chance to be one drawer or the other.
 
Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed a few problems with the Linux release of the game.
 - Fixed the positioning of the gab window as to not overlap with the map name display.
 - Fixed issues with the Village Headman's turning during the story of the Great Collapse.
 - Fixed textual errors in a few spots.

Alpha 14 (11/25/2021)
The Overhaul Update
Current Level Cap: 20
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
This is it. The update you all have been waiting for. Just like always, the latest update is the biggest one to date.
Consider this like a second or third fresh start for The Trail. I don't know, I don't remember what number we're on.
The sheer amount of changes, additions, bug fixes, and balancing is unprecedented in the history of The Trail. In fact, they are so great in number that I won't even bother to create an actual changelog.
Yeah, maybe I'm lazy. But at the same time, this is such an incredibly large overhaul that it can feel like a different game at times. Maybe it's not right to consider this an updated version of Alpha 13, and instead think of it as a re-imagining of the game.
There's a lot of things that will jump out at you as soon as you start playing the game. However, there's also an incredible amount of very small, barely noticeable things I've changed across the board that give the game a breath of fresh air.
Well, here is the lackluster "changelog" (hey, the less spoilers the better, right?):

Additions:
 - Added a new passive skill: Simp. It's unlocked by Player 2 at level 1 and is always active.
From awesome additions like a new dungeon for the Water Elemental, all the way to dope new mechanics like a time system, this update has it all.
Well... all may be a bit of understatement. While Alpha 14 is "The Overhaul Update," taking care of mostly every aspect of the game I've wanted to revisit for 3+ years, it's still not all-encompassing. However, it... still covers a ridiculously large number of bases.

Changes:
A huge amount of changes were made across the entire game, as expected. Some are obvious, like the 1280x720 resolution and music update, but did you notice stuff like how the status effect "On Fire!" now does constant damage over time instead of percentage-based?
Now, imagine a small change like that, and then have like 5000 of them. Yeah, a TON of stuff was changed. Praise be to the person who goes through all my GitHub commits and compiles everything together into a nice changelog!
(Seriously though, if someone managed to one day document every change made in this update, they would certainly have all my praises bestowed upon them.)

Balancing:
Look, I finally nerfed the crit formula. That's probably one of the most prominent balancing changes here.
However, I did make changes across the board to almost every piece of equipment and skill. The game should feel considerably more fair in many aspects now.
Oh, but how could I neglect to mention this? The battle system has been revamped, placing a lot of emphasis on the new Boost Point mechanic, as well as buffs/debuffs to stats that function on a scale from -5 to 5 (think Pokémon).
This is a part of the update that we will need a particularly high amount of community feedback to properly adjust and balance. Please leave any and all feedback in the Discord server!

Bug Fixes:
Fixed an INCREDIBLE amount of bugs, ranging from new to old to ancient.

Bugs we are aware of:
Yes, there are STILL just a couple bugs I haven't managed to squash from Alpha 13, and a few have popped up during the development of Alpha 14 that I haven't found a fix for just yet. Apologies for that...
But hey, there's no more need for this section thanks to the issue tracker on GitHub! It's been nice having this here for a while, but it's finally time to move on. Check out the issue tracker via the link below.
https://github.com/NoLongerLucky/thetrail/issues
 
Planned features:
Well, what do you know? Everything on this list has finally been ticked off. Looks like it might be time to retire this section too. It hasn't ever served much of a purpose, either...

Out of all the updates that I have ever developed for The Trail, this has by far been the most daunting yet fun to undertake. It's been amazing to see the game change and transform so much.
The Trail is finally starting to be like what I imagined it to be like all those years ago. All this time spent on it is paying off; I'm finally shaping the game to be just how I always wanted.
Now that the overhauling is finally out of the way, we will of course have a few sub-Alpha 14s to address bugs and make adjustments after listening to community feedback. However...
Alpha 15 approaches next. And while nothing might ever manage to top Alpha 14 in terms of sheer difference from the prior version, this upcoming update will be a jaw-dropper.
Telluria Castle... it approaches.

But as always...

...the journey continues.

Yours truly,
Andrew
