Balancing:

 - Nerfed the Steel Axe's stun chance by 5% (was originally 10%).
 - Increased price of Metal Wristbraces ★ from 180B to 300B.
 - Buffed the drop chance of rare enemy accessories from 1/3 to 1/2.
 - Ethers no longer require Bits to craft. Their price has been adjusted accordingly.

 - Fixed a bug where the little loot explosion after defeating an enemy sometimes did not show the correct drops.

 - Fixed a bug where playtime wouldn't increase correctly on non-60hz displays.

 - Fixed a bug where magic skills used the wrong motion when casting.
 - Fixed a bug where battlers affected by Frozen I would still have their sprite move if an action sequence commanded them to.
 - Fixed a bug where vA.14.7 removed Solus Town's snow but neglected to remove the snow around it in the overworld.
 - Just like usual, a huge amount of minor bugs, textual errors, and visual issues were corrected in this release.

OUTRO

Yours truly,
Andrew

                             ALPHA 14.7 CHANGELOG
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Alpha 14.7 (1/1/2022)
Current Level Cap: 20
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
Fixed a game-breaking bug where fighting the Giant Goblin after being sent by the Village Chief would completely lock a save's progression, essentially ruining the file.
This bug will be fixed in saves already affected by it, as long as old save patching is enabled.
Additionally, the snow over Solus Town has melted.
Oh, and happy new year, everyone!

Alpha 14.6 (12/22/2021)

- - - - - - - - - - - - -
Fixed a game-breaking bug where fresh downloads of the game would immediately crash upon attempting to save.

Alpha 14.5 (12/21/2021)
Current Level Cap: 20
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
This is a very technical update, mainly serving to continue improving the gameplay experience and make a few small QoL changes.

Additions:
 - Added actual descriptions to vanity items. They will show the set they are a part of, as well as a short summary of what the outfit looks like.
 - Re-added the category separators on the options menu. Additionally, 2 new options were added:
  ~ Disable Old Save Patching: Disables the automatic patching of old saves when updating.
  ~ Equipping Item Stays on Equip Window: When enabled, equipping an item will not return to the equipment slots window.
 - Added new information to the save menu.
  ~ Each save now shows its native version, which is updated every time it is saved in a different version. Pre-vA.14.5 saves or saves missing their version info will display as an unknown version.
  ~ Saves will also show the time that they were last saved, adjusted for the user's time zone. The time since the last save is also shown.
 - Although technically a change, a new damage popup system has replaced the old one. It comes with both visual and internal changes.
  ~ Skills and states that did not show damage popups (e.g. anything involving SP) will now either show a popup or work as intended.
 - The equip compare menu now shows life steal and attack element changes.
 - The status menu's "Attributes" page now shows life steal stats.

Changes:
 - Replaced the Forge Badge and Enchanting Badge with the Disposable Hammer and Enchanting Crystal, respectively. This is only a visual change, and the items still function exactly the same.
 - Obtaining any craftable item will mark it as crafted, even before hitting the Blazing Sands. This unmasks the name of the item and counts it towards the total crafting progress statistics in the crafting menu.
 - Loading/renaming a save now marks it as the "last accessed" file, making it automatically selected when the save menu is open.
 - Opening the options/save menu on the title screen will smoothly fade out the title screen and fade in the new menu. Leaving the menu will fade it out, then fade the title screen back in.
 - Adjusted the layout of the status menu's "Attributes" page. Additionally, the first two columns of attributes have had their names reformatted.
 - The equipment comparison menu now rounds the difference of most stats to 1 decimal place.
 - Reverted the new item indicator's appearance to its vA.14.0-UNST1 state.
 - The new item indicator now shows on the victory aftermath screen again.
 - Removed equip restrictions on Terra and Bubble (Tome).
 - When changing the equipment in a party member's Vanity slot, unequippable vanity items will not be shown.
 - Adjusted dialogue in Adon finale dream cutscene.
 - The preloader will now load animation files.
 - Changed the icons of the Charm of Foresight and several vanity items.

Balancing:
 - Nerfed the Sacrificial Dagger's CRI boost from +3% to +1.5%.

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed a bug where unallocating HP/MP when full would reduce MHP/MMP, then additionally remove another 5/3 HP/MP, leaving the party member without full HP/MP.
 - Fixed a bug where two completely unobtainable weapons were being added to the total weapons crafted stat's denominator.
 - Fixed a bug where the spacing of letters on name input screens would be uneven.
 - Fixed a bug where the sell price of Bronze/Steel Alloys was abnormally high... 3x higher than intended, in fact.
 - Fixed a bug where Player 4's vanities were still causing her face graphic to smile when in Telluria, even though this was meant to be removed in vA.14.3.
 - Fixed a bug where the Sea BGS would not fade out during the cutscene where the party clears the dirt pile in the north of the Blazing Sands.
 - Fixed many textual errors.

Items being automatically marked as crafted will work retroactively with previous saves. As long as an item has been hovered over in the items menu at least once before updating, the updated save will mark the item as crafted.
Run over all the items in your inventory before updating to be sure they don't have the new item indicator. This will ensure that any craftable items are properly marked as crafted.

                             ALPHA 14.4 CHANGELOG
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Alpha 14.4 (12/16/2021)
Current Level Cap: 20
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
Considering that Alpha 14.3 was intended to be the last sub-alpha with notable content, Alpha 14.4 doesn't have anything too crazy. However, there's plenty of bug fixes and changes that make this update worth it!

Additions:
 - Added 2 new armors:
  ~ Iron Boots
  ~ Slime Scarf
 - Added a new feature that allows save files to be renamed.

Changes:
 - Player 4 no longer learns Steal Item at level 12, and will instead learn Offensive Stance. Transferred saves with Player 4 already at level 12 or above will automatically have her skills updated.
 - Deleting a save file will now just apply .bak to the end of the file instead of completely deleting it, allowing accidentally deleted save files to be retrieved.
 - A Game Over will now be triggered if the entire party is afflicted with either Downed or Terrified.
  ~ This was mainly done to prevent long battles against Lost Souls when your only living party members were incapacitated by Terrified.
 - Will now sells ATK, MAT, DEF, and MDF scrolls.
 - The Knight and Rogue classes now have a Magic Equip equipment slot.
 - The shop menu's sell window now shows category icons in a 4x4 grid.
 - Puzzle reset buttons now require confirmation before resetting the puzzle.
 - Changed the recipe for Vishnu's Charm to use the Slime Scarf.
 - Slightly increased the encounter rate in the Bandito Hideout.
 - Some dialogues will be altered slightly depending on actions that have been done during the game (e.g. the party only knows about the Archaic Hourglass when fighting The Warden if Will has given them the quest).

Balancing:
 - Changed around some item drop rates.
  ~ Buffed the drop rate of rare enemy accessories from 20% to 33.3%.
  ~ Buffed the drop rate of status resistance accessories from 1% to 2%.
  ~ Buffed the drop rate of presents from 10% to 20%.
 - Adjusted the Floppy Hat ★ and the Prayer Headpiece to function more as counterparts to each other, with the former focusing on MAT and the latter focusing on MDF.
 - Buffed Ice I's MAT multiplier from 200% to 225%.
 - Nerfed The Warden's offensive stats slightly to allow for more fair on-level interactions.

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed a bug with the Lost Soul AI that caused battles against it to sometimes take a really long time. The bug also sometimes prevented party members from being able to do anything for no apparent reason.
 - Fixed a bug with the Lightning I/II chain lightning formulas.
 - Fixed a bug where saves transferred from vA.14.4 would softlock upon entering Player 1's house. This was because the "Player 2's Meal" cutscene would be triggered.
 - Fixed a bug where boosting and then unboosting could allow escape from normally unescapable battles.
 - Fixed a bug where Shield of Faith and Strength Within the Blade's shield would expire after 5 or 2 turns, respectively.
 - Fixed a bug where Player 3 and Player 4 could escape Sector 4 when ditching the rest of the party.
 - Fixed a bug where The Warden wouldn't apply Terrified to the party at the beginning of his battle.
 - Fixed a bug where Henry's Play Dirty skill could fill up the battle log.
 - Fixed a bug where skills with a learn requirement of level 0 would still show the level requirement.
 - Fixed several bugs related to interactions between the Blazing Sands's godrays and the nighttime overlay.
 - Fixed several bugs related to footstep sounds in many locations.
 - Fixed an oddly specific bug related to the statue of Trailia in Solus Valley and the Shop Menu Stat Compare Style option.
 - Fixed many other minor bugs.

Alpha 14.3 (12/11/2021)
Current Level Cap: 20
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
This sub-alpha is a pretty important one! It shakes up the progression in early Telluria, and fixes a ton of bugs. Let's get straight into the changelog!

Additions:
 - Added in a brand new cutscene at the start of Chapter 3.
  ~ This cutscene replaces some old content, notably the camping cutscene when first setting foot on Telluria.
 - Added in 4 new Vanity equipment items.
  ~ Retro Knight/Mage/Cleric/Rogue Outfit
  ~ Each can be purchased from the Holiday Merchant for 3 Leeks. A more permanent home for them will be found in a future update.
 - Revamped the equipment menu.
  ~ The layout has been completely redone.
  ~ The window on the right now has headings for which section is being shown (Stat Comparison, Item Info, Restrictions).
 - Revamped the shop menu stat comparison window.
  ~ Now shows 1 stat for 4 party members  by default rather than the old 8 stats for 1 party member. The old style can be reverted to in the settings.
  ~ If a party member is unable to equip a piece of equipment present in the shop, it will say so.
  ~ Class icons are shown on each party member's name.

Changes:
 - Completely redid the Easin Plains progression to allow the player to go in any order.
  ~ Greenfield, the Water Elemental, Solus Valley, and the Giant Goblin: that's right, you can tackle them in any order you want now!
  ~ All dialogue, quest log entries, etc. will be automatically adjusted depending on what order you do everything in.
 - Improved the experience of navigating Laeryidyean's Forest.
 - Made changes to the dream cutscene at the end of Chapter 2.

Balancing:
 - Adjusted Cut Down.
  ~ Only ignores 50% of enemy DEF rather than all of it.
  ~ Can now land critical hits.
 - Heavily nerfed Goblin/Goblin Captain common item drop rates.
 - Nerfed the EVA and CRI provided by Leather/Hermes Boots.

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed a bug where bosses with the Night Boost status effect and an ending sequence at 0% health could never actually start that ending sequence.
 - Fixed a bug with the Ruby/Emerald Ring drop sources.
 - Fixed tons of minor visual/textual bugs.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                             ALPHA 14.2 CHANGELOG
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Alpha 14.2 (11/30/2021)
Current Level Cap: 20
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
Another sub-alpha! This one fixes quite a few bugs with the game, and also addresses feedback given by the community.

Additions:
 - Re-added the equip optimize button, a missed feature from Alpha 13.
 - Recovery item descriptions will show how much HP/MP they recover, both static and percentage.
 - Added a merchant in Sector 2 of Adon that sells Small Potions and Small Elixirs. He will disappear after Laeryidyean has been defeated.
  ~ As a result of this, the soldier outside the Bandito Hideout that's always sold Small Elixirs will now sell them at 16B rather than 20B.
 
Changes:
 - Replaced Player 1's Defend I/II and Mark skills with three new skills.
  ~ Hold the Line I: Learned by Player 1 at level 5.
  ~ Hold the Line II: Learned by Player 1 through the skill menu starting at level 15.
  ~ Weak Point: Learned by Player 1 at level 7.
  ~ All enemies that used Defend I/II or Mark in their AI have had their AI modified to use the new skills.
  ~ Already-existing save files will retroactively learn the new skills and have the old ones removed. Mastery levels will be migrated.
 - Equip restrictions on all hats except Matt's Fedora have been removed. Have fun mixing and matching!
 - The status menu and equip comparison menu now have 1 decimal of precision for stats other than the main 8.
 - Player 1, Player 2, and Player 4 can now all learn Analyze using the skill learn menu.
 - Skeleton Warriors and Skeleton Mages can now drop Small Potions and Small Elixirs.
 - Completely disabled the battle intro. It was just too buggy and the effect wasn't worth it. Besides, most people just turn it off after the first few times.
 - Reduced the amount of skeletons found in Laeryidyean's Forest - Center.
 - Trimmed down some dialogue in a few spots.

Balancing:
 - Nerfed the Skeleton Mage.
  ~ ATK: 10 → 8
  ~ DEF: 12 → 9
  ~ MAT: 24 → 20
  ~ MDF: 24 → 20
  ~ Cure I will now be used at or below 30% HP rather than the old 50%.
  ~ Cure I will only have a 60% chance of being used when meeting the HP condition rather than the old 100%.
 - Nerfed the Skeleton Warrior.
  ~ MDF: 20 → 12
 - Reduced the cost of Floppy Hat ★ from 50B to 35B.
 - Nerfed Charm of Foresight from +10% CEV to +5% CEV

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed an annoying bug where skipping through Player 2's dialogue during the walk-and-talk with him could softlock the game.
 - The Items menu and the Run Away option can no longer be selected with at least 1 boost active.
 - Fixed a bug where Player 2 could leave Sector 2 by himself while Player 1 and Mark are talking.
 - A lot of minor textual errors were fixed.

                             ALPHA 14.1 CHANGELOG
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Alpha 14.1 (11/26/2021)
Current Level Cap: 20
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
Here we are, the first sub-alpha for Alpha 14. It came quickly, too!
This little update mainly serves to add... holiday content! That's right, for the month of December, you'll get access to some fun new stuff.
Additionally, some issues found in Alpha 14 have been addressed in order to further improve the gameplay experience.

Additions:
 - The holidays are here! A few special things will start happening during the month of December:
  ~ Every enemy in the game has a 10% chance to drop a Present.
  ~ A new NPC known as the Holiday Merchant can be found in all 6 towns in the game, even during the prologue. He'll sell you all the new holiday items in exchange for Presents.
  ~ The game's window skin receives a jolly coat of paint. Additionally, the menu particles change to snowflakes!
 - The affectionately dubbed "Snowlus Town" has returned at long last! I unfortunately don't know how to automate the tiles changing just yet, so the town will be reverted to its old greenness in the first update of 2022.
 - Added in 7 new holiday themed items:
  ~ Present
  ~ Fizzy Cranberry Beverage
  ~ Festive Sword/Wand/Staff/Dagger Scroll
  ~ Icon Reset Scroll
 - Added in 5 new holiday themed weapons:
  ~ Candy Cane Sword/Wand/Staff/Dagger
  ~ Leek Sword
 - Added in 5 new holiday themed armors:
  ~ Festive Armor/Robes/Vestments/Leathers
  ~ Candy Cane Shield
 - Aside from those, another 6 armors have been added to the game that can be found at any time:
  ~ Leather Charm
  ~ Music Box
  ~ Vishnu's Charm
  ~ Condensed White Gel
  ~ Metallic Rat Pelt
  ~ Arcane Leather Charm
  
Changes:
 - Changed around drops of state resistance accessories to be more consistent. Additionally, the accessories will always have a 1% drop from their enemy type, regardless if the specific enemy is normal, rare, or a boss.
 - The location of the Bandito Loot found in the drawers in the Bandito Hideout has been randomized using the new "Playthrough Seed" set at the start of each run. It's a 50/50 chance to be one drawer or the other.
 
Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed a few problems with the Linux release of the game.
 - Fixed the positioning of the gab window as to not overlap with the map name display.
 - Fixed issues with the Village Headman's turning during the story of the Great Collapse.
 - Fixed textual errors in a few spots.

Alpha 14 (11/25/2021)
The Overhaul Update
Current Level Cap: 20
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
This is it. The update you all have been waiting for. Just like always, the latest update is the biggest one to date.
Consider this like a second or third fresh start for The Trail. I don't know, I don't remember what number we're on.
The sheer amount of changes, additions, bug fixes, and balancing is unprecedented in the history of The Trail. In fact, they are so great in number that I won't even bother to create an actual changelog.
Yeah, maybe I'm lazy. But at the same time, this is such an incredibly large overhaul that it can feel like a different game at times. Maybe it's not right to consider this an updated version of Alpha 13, and instead think of it as a re-imagining of the game.
There's a lot of things that will jump out at you as soon as you start playing the game. However, there's also an incredible amount of very small, barely noticeable things I've changed across the board that give the game a breath of fresh air.
Well, here is the lackluster "changelog" (hey, the less spoilers the better, right?):

Additions:
 - Added a new passive skill: Simp. It's unlocked by Player 2 at level 1 and is always active.
From awesome additions like a new dungeon for the Water Elemental, all the way to dope new mechanics like a time system, this update has it all.
Well... all may be a bit of understatement. While Alpha 14 is "The Overhaul Update," taking care of mostly every aspect of the game I've wanted to revisit for 3+ years, it's still not all-encompassing. However, it... still covers a ridiculously large number of bases.

Changes:
A huge amount of changes were made across the entire game, as expected. Some are obvious, like the 1280x720 resolution and music update, but did you notice stuff like how the status effect "On Fire!" is now does constant damage over time instead of percentage-based?
Now, imagine a small change like that, and then have like 5000 of them. Yeah, a TON of stuff was changed. Praise be to the person who goes through all my GitHub commits and compiles everything together into a nice changelog!
(Seriously though, if someone managed to one day document every change made in this update, they would certainly have all my praises bestowed upon them.)

Balancing:
Look, I finally nerfed the crit formula. That's probably one of the most prominent balancing changes here.
However, I did make changes across the board to almost every piece of equipment and skill. The game should feel considerably more fair in many aspects now.
Oh, but how could I neglect to mention this? The battle system has been revamped, placing a lot of emphasis on the new Boost Point mechanic, as well as buffs/debuffs to stats that function on a scale from -5 to 5 (think Pokémon).
This is a part of the update that we will need a particularly high amount of community feedback to properly adjust and balance. Please leave any and all feedback in the Discord server!

Bug Fixes:
Fixed an INCREDIBLE amount of bugs, ranging from new to old to ancient.

Bugs we are aware of:
Yes, there are STILL just a couple bugs I haven't managed to squash from Alpha 13, and a few have popped up during the development of Alpha 14 that I haven't found a fix for just yet. Apologies for that...
But hey, there's no more need for this section thanks to the issue tracker on GitHub! It's been nice having this here for a while, but it's finally time to move on. Check out the issue tracker via the link below.

Planned features:
Well, what do you know? Everything on this list has finally been ticked off. Looks like it might be time to retire this section too. It hasn't ever served much of a purpose, either...

Out of all the updates that I have ever developed for The Trail, this has by far been the most daunting yet fun to undertake. It's been amazing to see the game change and transform so much.
The Trail is finally starting to be like what I imagined it to be like all those years ago. All this time spent on it is paying off; I'm finally shaping the game to be just how I always wanted.
Now that the overhauling is finally out of the way, we will of course have a few sub-Alpha 14s to address bugs and make adjustments after listening to community feedback. However...
Alpha 15 approaches next. And while nothing might ever manage to top Alpha 14 in terms of sheer difference from the prior version, this upcoming update will be a jaw-dropper.
Telluria Castle... it approaches.

But as always...

...the journey continues.

Yours truly,
Andrew
